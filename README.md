The Note Taking App is a lightweight web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes directly in the browser. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app uses the browser's LocalStorage to store notes, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. The app features an intuitive interface where users can add a title and content to each note, save changes, and remove notes as needed. No backend is required, making it highly portable and privacy-friendly, as all data remains on the user's device. The application could be further enhanced by adding features like categorization, search functionality, or offline support via Progressive Web App (PWA) techniques.
